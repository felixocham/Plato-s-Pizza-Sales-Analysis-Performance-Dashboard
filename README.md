# Plato-s-Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Performance-Dashboard
This project is part of the Maven Pizza Challenge. Acting as a BI Consultant for Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizzeria in New Jersey, I was tasked with analyzing a year's worth of transactional data. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable insights to help the restaurant improve operational efficiency and increase sales.
